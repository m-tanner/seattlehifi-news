# seattlehifi.news

## Features

- Password-less login. Let the email providers handle this. Emails cannot be changed for a profile once set. Would need to unsubscribe and make a fresh subscription.
- Email verification is enforced and cannot be modified for a given account after its creation
- "Buy Me a Coffee" button. I'm happy to remove this, just seemed fun to me. It would be a place for people to "buy me a coffee" if they find the site useful.
- "Report a Bug" button. Links out to my Github repo issue tracking system for users to report bugs or submit feature requests if necessary/desired.
- Users can set:
  - Their preferred name
  - Favorite keywords or phrases
  - Toggle whether they want to only get notified about listings that match one or more keywords
  - Unsubscribe
- Admin accounts based on email domain
- Admins get an additional button to trigger the notifications pipeline. This means it would trigger the code to fetch all product listings, determine if there are any new ones, and email out according to user preferences.
- Click-through tracking
